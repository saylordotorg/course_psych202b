**Unit 5: Activity: Sample Experimental paper** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, you will practice writing a research paper.  Although
your paper will not reflect any actual data and will lack the depth of
traditional research paper, this activity will require you to synthesize
what you have learned in the previous units by asking you to demonstrate
how you would design and carry out a working experiment.   You should
identify and explain the reasoning behind your choices, methods, and
measurement techniques.  The inclusion of statistical knowledge is
desirable but not necessary.  The goal of this exercise is to illustrate
that practical applications can diverge from strict theory.*
