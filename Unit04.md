**Unit 4: Measurement and Statistics** <span id="4"></span> 
*You have now performed each of the steps necessary to design your
experiment, but how will you be able to tell whether your result is
significant?  This unit will present different techniques for measuring
your result.  The lecture portion of this course introduced the concepts
behind these techniques, but we will now learn to determine when and how
to use each of them.  While we will discuss statistics in this unit, a
sophisticated understanding of the subject is unnecessary.   That being
said, a working knowledge of statistics is a valuable asset during all
stages of experimentation.   In this unit, you should identify the
measurement techniques most applicable to your question and design and
be able to explain your selection.*
