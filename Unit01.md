**Unit 1: Developing a Research Question** <span id="1"></span> 
*One of the most important—and frequently overlooked—steps in successful
research occurs prior to laboratory experimentation, when the researcher
develops a question that can be accurately and effectively studied.
  Though psychologists generate these questions in a number of different
ways, many of the most successful arise from previous experiments
performed by either the researcher him or herself or from others in the
field.   However, even when a psychologist is building from existing
research, there are a number of elements he or she must consider when
establishing the parameters for further research.   In this unit, we
will discuss different methods for the formulation of a solid research
question as well as ways to determine the scientific value of a given
experiment.  As we move through this unit, you should begin to develop a
research question you are interested in reviewing or researching.*

     Instructions: On the above webpage, please read through the various
    sections of step 1 (Risk/Benefit Analysis) and apply these questions
    to your research question.  Under section A (“Identifying Risks”),
    click on the link to the “Identifying Risks Table” to learn about
    various potential risks.

**1.2 A Call for Replication** <span id="1.2"></span> 
**1.2.1 How to Replicate Previous Research** <span id="1.2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Santa Clara University: Dr Jerry Burger’s “Replicating
    Milgram: Would People Still Obey Today?”**
    Link: Santa Clara University: Dr Jerry Burger’s [“Replicating
    Milgram: Would People Still Obey
    Today?”](http://cms.scu.edu/cas/psychology/faculty/burger.cfm) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Clicking on the above link will bring you to Dr.
    Jerry Burger’s webpage.  Please scroll down to the section titled
    “Research and Representative Publications” and select “Replicating
    Milgram: Would People Still Obey Today?”  In PSYCH202, you read
    about the importance of replication as well as Jerry Burger’s
    partial replication of Milgram’s famous obedience experiment.
     Please read through this in order to see an important real world
    example of a replication.  
      
     As you are reading the article, consider whether or not you think
    the replication was necessary, what the risks were, and whether or
    not it added to previous knowledge.  Also, please note that this was
    a partial replication (meaning not all aspects of the original
    experiment were conducted) and consider the reasons for this.  This
    reading also applies to subunit 1.2.2.

    to the list of writing guides, and under the section “Scientific
    Writing & APA Format,” click on “Writing a Psychology Literature
    Review” to download the PDF.  Please save this file as you will need
    to access it again for subunits 2.1.2 and 2.2.  
      
     As you learned in PSYCH202, research ideas are often based on
    previous research.  Please read the first two pages of this guide
    (through Library Research) to learn about the steps in developing
    your research question based on previous research and planning your
    literature review.  As you read this, start to think about the
    searches you could conduct on your topic, and ask yourself how you
    might narrow it down based on the previous studies you might find as
    a result of your research.  This reading applies to subunits
    1.3.1-1.3.3.
