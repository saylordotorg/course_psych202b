**Unit 3: Study Designs** <span id="3"></span> 
*In the lecture section of this course, we reviewed the types and
purposes of many of the study designs most commonly used in psychology
research today.  However, real-life examples of these theoretical
designs may not appear as clear-cut as they did in theory.  While it is
important to be able to recognize which research designs are most
applicable to certain research question, it is equally as important to
understand how designs can be shaped in order to fit a question—a matter
we will discuss in this unit.   We will first review the design
structures described in the lecture and then take a look at experiments
in which researchers applied design structures to real-life questions.
 You should determine which study design is most appropriate to your
research question.*

     Instructions: Please listen to the entire first lecture and through
    minute 10 of the second lecture on experimental design for an
    overview of what defines a true experiment.  Note the description of
    a correlational study related to school achievement and television
    viewing.  
      
     Toward the end of this lecture, the lecturer goes through the
    process of setting up an experimental design.  Pay close attention
    to these steps if you are planning to use an experimental design in
    order to investigate your topic of interest.  The example he
    discusses is an independent group design.  Also note that the
    lecturer addresses an important topic in the second link: the
    placebo effect.  Pay close attention to this.  This lecture applies
    to subunits 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.
