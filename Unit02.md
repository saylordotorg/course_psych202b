**Unit 2: The Literature Review** <span id="2"></span> 
*As researchers develop their questions, they must perform a review of
existing literature in order to discover previous studies conducted in
their areas of interest and identify gaps in the field’s body of
research.   Frequently, these gaps are just as important—if not more
so—than the body of existing research.   This brief unit will present
ways of finding, accessing, and narrowing existing research
documentation through either the Internet or a library.   By the end of
this unit, the student should feel comfortable with this process, as it
will be performed frequently throughout both the remainder of this
program and over the course of your career in psychology.  You should
also consider performing a literature review for the question you
developed in Unit 1.*
